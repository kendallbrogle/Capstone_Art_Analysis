This script performs various data analysis and modeling tasks on a dataset:

It loads data from two CSV files: "theArt.csv" and "theData.csv."
The script conducts statistical tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test, and creates box plots to compare different groups within the dataset.
It performs linear regression, cross-validation, and model evaluation.
The script uses K-means clustering to analyze clusters based on two features.
It conducts Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on specific features and evaluates the results.
The script builds a random forest classifier and analyzes its performance.
Extra credit work includes additional PCA analysis and linear regression on a different set of features.
The script generates various visualizations to help understand the data, evaluate statistical tests, and interpret the results of the analysis
